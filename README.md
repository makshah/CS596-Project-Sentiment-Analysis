<li>Members: Rachana Ramesh(824674286), Durgashree Shetty(822065511), Meet Shah (824166818) </li>
<li>Dataset: Twitter Sentiment Analysis (AnalyticsVidhya) </li>
<li>Packages used: numpy, pandas, nltk, sklearn, gensim, torch,  </li>
<l>
The backend code for each model is written in the '.py' files which we have imported in the main.ipynb file.  

<b>Note:</b> 
<br>
<li>Make sure that *Logistic_Regression_Sentiment_Analysis.py*, *LSTM_RNN_Sentiment_Analysis.py* , *SVM_Sentiment_Analysis.py* are in the same directory as the *Sentiment Analysis.ipynb* </li>
<li>Make sure that the datasets: *TrainingData.csv* and *TestingData.csv* are in the same directory as the main.ipynb </li>
<li>The outputs for Logistic Regression are stored in the ".csv" file named *Logistic_bag_of_words.csv* and *Logistic_TFIDF.csv* for Sentiment Analysis using Bag of Words method and TF-IDF method respectively.</li>
<li>The outputs for SVM are stored in the ".csv" file named *sub_svm_bow.csv* and *sub_svm_tf.csv* for Bag of Words method and TF-IDF method respectively.</li>
<li>The outputs for LSTM RNN are stored in the ".csv" file named *RNN_submission.csv*.</li>
