CS596 - MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT: Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression.

Members: Rachana Ramesh(824674286), Durgashree Shetty(822065511), Meet Shah (824166818)

Dataset: Twitter Sentiment Analysis (AnalyticsVidhya)

Packages used: numpy, pandas, nltk, sklearn, gensim, torch,
The backend code for each model is written in the '.py' files which we have imported in the main.ipynb file.

Note:
- Make sure that Logistic_Regression_Sentiment_Analysis.py, LSTM_RNN_Sentiment_Analysis.py , SVM_Sentiment_Analysis.py are in the same directory as the Main.ipynb
- Make sure that the datasets: TrainingData.csv and TestingData.csv are in the same directory as the Sentiment Analysis.ipynb
- The outputs for Logistic Regression are stored in the ".csv" file named Logistic_bag_of_words.csv and Logistic_TFIDF.csv for Sentiment Analysis using Bag of Words method and TF-IDF method respectively.
- The outputs for SVM are stored in the ".csv" file named sub_svm_bow.csv and sub_svm_tf.csv for Bag of Words method and TF-IDF method respectively.
- The outputs for LSTM RNN are stored in the ".csv" file named RNN_submission.csv.
